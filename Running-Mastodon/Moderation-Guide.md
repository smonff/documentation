Moderator's guide
=================

Mastodon decentralization makes possible for an instance to be run under it's own community rules. The administration panel provide powerful tools to *enforce* those rules.

Mastodon have been developed with a set of tools making possible for an instance moderators to stick on it's policies by blacklisting other instances, muting or blocking users. It has been called [*abuse-handling tools*](https://medium.com/@Gargron/learning-from-twitters-mistakes-c272d67bba76), by keeping in mind what we learned from Twitter mistakes.
